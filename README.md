# rise-up.exe
The name of this app is aimed to signify to users how building their experience and skills can lead to a rise in self-value. The added '.exe' is a play with the technical term that is present in every machine - but also to highlight to users that "executing" the advise learnt via this app can lead to a positive outcome.

This is a project designed to provide prospective students with guidance in the cyber security field. Rendered through the use of Python and Django.
This app is focusing on building diversity within the security sector, so the web app will display available mentors which the user is able to select, a specialised career pathway diagram and a handy security blog.
By the end of the project, there should be 3 models: mentor/guidance/blog.
This app will hopefully entice prospecive employees to seek a career in such an exciting industry via the use of available mentors, specialised guidance information and a useful blog to learn more about security.
Thank You!
