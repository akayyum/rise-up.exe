# rise-up.exe
This is a project designed to provide prospective students with guidance in the cyber security field. Rendered through the use of Python and Django.
This app is focusing on building diversity within the security sector, so the web app will display available mentors which the user is able to select.
By the end of the project, there should be 3 models: mentor/guidance/selected.
This app will hopefully entice prospecive employees to seek a career in such an exciting industry via the use of available mentors, specialised guidance information and a useful blog to learn more about security.
Thank You!
